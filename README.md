## üßê About <a name="about"></a>
An optimized and plug and play console application that automatically retrieves your YouTube Music from your browser.

### What does it do? ü§î
You know the Rich Presence that you see when your friends listen to [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/)?

</p>

This project replicates that but for [YouTube Music](https://music.youtube.com/)! It will automatically retrieve all data from your currently opened browser,
meaning that you only need to open YouTube Music in your browser and have Discord open for this to work. We truly live in the golden age! ‚ú®

#### Supported Browsers üï∏
Please feel free to commit a PR to support more browsers, since there are [Selenium](https://www.selenium.dev/selenium/docs/api/dotnet/) webdrivers for other browsers too!

| Browser | Currently Supported | Instructions |
| ------- | --------- | ----- |

#### Supported Streaming Services
Obviously the project's original scope was only YouTube Music, hence it's the only currently supported. Adding support for other services is not a priority.

### Why?! üò±
One of my friends listens to music on Spotify the entire day during work, so I can see what music he listens to. However, other people in my friendgroup use YouTube Music, which does not have rich presence support. This screamt for a solution!

#### But that solution already exists!
There are indeed already multiple implementations for this. However, most of them had one of the following issues:
- Some were using way **too much RAM** for what it should do.
- Some were **reading history files** in your browser (I am not kidding! I have actually seen this!!!).
- Some contain an **unnecessary GUI**.
- They were programmed using **complicated unoptimized libraries** to achieve their goal.

### Features üåü

## üéà Usage <a name="usage"></a>
1. Open the Discord app. -> _This does not work in your browser!_
1. Select a browser of your choosing.
1. Go to the docs folder in this project and look for that browser. For example the Chrome instructions [here](docs/_instructions_chrome.md).
1. Follow that one instruction and you're already done. From now on you only have to boot this software and Bob's your uncle!
